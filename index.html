        <h2>Security info replacement</h2>
          <p>Someone started a process to replace all of the security info for your Microsoft account.</p>
          <p>If this was you, you can safely ignore this email. Your security info will be replaced with <a href="url">[[-Email-]]</a> when the 30-day waiting period is over.</p>
          <p>If this wasn't you, someone else might be trying to take over your Microsoft account. <a href="url">Click here</a> and we'll help you protect this account.</p>
          <p>Thanks,</p>
